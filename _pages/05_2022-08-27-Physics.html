<ul>
  <li>scalar quantites are those that have magnitude but no direction, example - speed, time, distance. Vector Quantities are those that have bith magnitude and direction, example - displacement, velocity, force.</li>
  <li>Position
    <ul>
      <li>defined in terms of a frame of refrence. gneerally the x- or y- axis.</li>
      <li>The objecs position is it’s location with repect to the frame of reference</li>
      <li>vector</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Position vs time graph -
    <ul>
      <li>The graph shows the motion of the particle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Displacement
    <ul>
      <li>Defined as the change in position during some time interval</li>
      <li>represented as △x; Si unit - (m). Vector.
        <ul>
          <li>△x = x final - x initial</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Average speed = total distance / total time taken, scalar.</li>
  <li>Average velocity = total displacement / total time taken, vector.</li>
  <li>both the above quantities are slope in distnace vs time and displacement vs time graph respectively</li>
  <li>Instantateous Velocity = The limit of the average velocity as the time interva becomes infinitesimally short, or as the time interval approches 0
    <ul>
      <li>The instantaneous velocity indicates what is happening at every point of time</li>
      <li>General equation - v_x=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{dx}{dt}</li>
      <li>can be positive, negative or zero</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
