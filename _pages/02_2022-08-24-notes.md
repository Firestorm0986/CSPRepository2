## Notes for the first Trimester -

### Terms and Definitions -

| Terms | Definitions |
|-|-|
| Function | A group of related statements that perform a specific task |
| def | The command to define a function |
| Parameter| Variables for the values the function needs. Is passed as an argument when the function is called |
| Variable | A way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define |
| List |  A “container” that can store any kinds of values |
| Repository | A location where all the files for a particular project are stored |
| String | A series of readable or usable sentences that the user will use | 
| len() | Returns the length (the number of items) of an object |
| return | Used to return from a function (break out of the function) |

## Notes for the second Trimester -

### Terms and Definitions -

- Bits - Smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
- Bytes - A unit of data that is eight binary digits long
- Hexadecimal - A numbering system with base 16
- Binary Numbers - A numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit -- 0 or 1 :
- Unsigned Integer - Just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them
- Signed Integer - Represent both positive and negative numbers
- Floating Point - A positive or negative whole number with a decimal point
- Binary Data Abstractions - Reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole:
- Boolean - A logical data type that can have only the values true or false
- ASCII - The most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet
- Unicode - Universal character representation standard for text in computer processing
- RGB - A system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display
- Data Compression - the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size:
- Lossy - the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression
- Lossless - restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed
- Variable - A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program
- Data types - A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error
- Assignment Operation - The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element
Managing Complexity with Variables - Establishes a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level:
- Lists - abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once
- 2D Lists - collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name
Dictionaries - an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs
- Class - template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object
- Sequence - the order in which the statements are executed
- Selection - a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met
- Iteration - a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing
- Expressions - a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value
- Booleans Expressions and Iteration - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE where a process can be repeated
- Truth Tables - a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit
- Characters - a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol
- Strings - a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable
- Length - The length of a data type, can be number of characters or number of data
- Concatenation - the operation of joining two strings together
- Upper - Uppercase characters
- Lower - Lowercase characters
- Traversing Strings - accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript
- Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - Conditionals that occur while a specific process is being repeated - can be stopped or passed
- Procedural Abstraction - when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters
- Python Def procedures - A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name
- Return Values - ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function
- Problem: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically
- Decision Problem: A problem with a yes or no answer
- Organization Problem: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer
- Instance: a problem with a specific input
- Efficiency: amount of computing needed to solve a problem
- Polynomial Efficiency (Good): more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time)
- Exponential Efficiency (Bad): more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time)
- Heuristic Approach: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient
- Decidable Problem: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output
- Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution that is not gaurenteed to produce the correct output
- special keyword Import requiered to access methods and fucntions
- Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word "from", followed by the package name, then the word "import", then the method. 
- This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use "*".
- you can re name the package using "as" for example "import random as rd"
- Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring
- Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result
- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world
- Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world
- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon
Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects
- Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded
- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration
- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators
Examples: rolling dice
