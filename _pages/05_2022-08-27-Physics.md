# Physics Quick Notes

## motion in 2 dimenstional space:
- scalar quantites are those that have magnitude but no direction, example - speed, time, distance. Vector Quantities are those that have bith magnitude and direction, example - displacement, velocity, force.
- Position 
    - defined in terms of a frame of refrence. gneerally the x- or y- axis.
    - The objecs position is it's location with repect to the frame of reference
    - vector
- Position vs time graph - 
    - The graph shows the motion of the particle 
- Displacement 
    - Defined as the change in position during some time interval
    - represented as △x; Si unit - (m). Vector.
        - △x = x final - x initial
- Average speed = total distance / total time taken, scalar. 
- Average velocity = total displacement / total time taken, vector.
- both the above quantities are slope in distnace vs time and displacement vs time graph respectively
- Instantateous Velocity = The limit of the average velocity as the time interva becomes infinitesimally short, or as the time interval approches 0
    - The instantaneous velocity indicates what is happening at every point of time
    - General equation - v_x=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{dx}{dt}
    - can be positive, negative or zero
