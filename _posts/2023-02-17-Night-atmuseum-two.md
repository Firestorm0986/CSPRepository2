## What is Night @ the Museum 
One night near the end of the trimester where students in art and craft classes can show off their progress and work to their parents and fellow students. 
Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best afterpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. 
During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks.

I have already taken this course and it always astonishes me how creative and amazing some of these 3D animations can be. I loved the above two pictures the most due to the attention to detail and the background. Also how it was different from the rest especially the person holding his head.

The nut is my favorite and I also am fascinated by how they sculpt such things in such short amount of time. I love the mugs as well due to the color and design. The nut had great attention to detail and was very realistic.

This image was one of my favorites as it was very different and if you looked at it in different angles the image that popped up was different. This was very cool and immediately captured my attention.
