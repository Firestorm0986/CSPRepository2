## Notes of Gratitude 
I wrote two notes of grattitude one for my childhood freind and another for my parents. To my friend, I thanked him for staying with me for many years and helping me when I needed. I tried to express my gratitude sincerely and fully. He was very grateful for the note. In the note to my parents I thanked them for helping me become who I am today. I expressed my gratitude for them and I also showed my appreciation for them doing many things for me (driving me, cooking for me, doing laundery, cleaning, etc.). They were also very grateful for my note and said they were proud of me.
