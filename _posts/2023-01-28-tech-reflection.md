## Digital Divide

### Question 1
- Some one can empower themselves in this digital world is by
- Learn about online privacy and security
- Take control of personal data
- Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication
- Keep software and devices up to date
- Be cautious with email and avoid phishing scams
- Limit personal information shared online
- Use reliable sources for information
- Understand digital rights and laws.

### Question 2
- Someone who is already empowered and has technology that is needed in this digital world can give away their used devices and help someone not empowered buy products that are essential for them to function in this world. We can create Gofund me to build money for someone who needs financial aid. We can as I said before give away used devices. We can also - 
- Share knowledge and resources on digital literacy 
- Mentor or tutor individuals in technology skills
- Collaborate on community projects that promote digital inclusion
- Advocate for policies that support digital equity
- Organize workshops or events to raise awareness on digital empowerment

### Question 3
Yes, there is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment. But the extent of such red tapes is based upon the location and context.
- Some countries have red tapes like laws and regulations that limit the access to certain technology. Unequal digital infrastructure can put some countries above others in terms of digital empowerment.
- In Del Norte High school, because of the high school being a public school they lack enough funding to empower every student equally.

### Question 3
- Yes dopamine issues are real. Companies like instagram and tik tok also use it to keep users engaged and on the app. Even games use it. Instagram uses colors to trigger chemical signals to activate tour dopamine levels which make you feel "good". 
- Something that is impacting my personal study is the use of addictive and attractive color scheme used by apps like instagram to pull in users and keep them on the app for a long time. This causes me loose my productivity and makes me stay up late at night trying to finish all my work.
