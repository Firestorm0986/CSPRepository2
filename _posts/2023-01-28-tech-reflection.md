## Digital Divide

### Question 1
- Some one can empower themselves in this digital world is by
- Learn about online privacy and security
- Take control of personal data
- Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication
- Keep software and devices up to date
- Be cautious with email and avoid phishing scams
- Limit personal information shared online
- Use reliable sources for information
- Understand digital rights and laws.

### Question 2
- Someone who is already empowered and has technology that is needed in this digital world can give away their used devices and help someone not empowered buy products that are essential for them to function in this world. We can create Gofund me to build money for someone who needs financial aid. We can as I said before give away used devices. We can also - 
- Share knowledge and resources on digital literacy 
- Mentor or tutor individuals in technology skills
- Collaborate on community projects that promote digital inclusion
- Advocate for policies that support digital equity
- Organize workshops or events to raise awareness on digital empowerment

### Question 3
Yes, there is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment. But the extent of such red tapes is based upon the location and context.
- Some countries have red tapes like laws and regulations that limit the access to certain technology. Unequal digital infrastructure can put some countries above others in terms of digital empowerment.
- In Del Norte High school, because of the high school being a public school they lack enough funding to empower every student equally.

Harmful effects:
- Privacy concerns with unintentional audio recording
- Increased background noise and interference
- Increased battery drain due to constant microphone usage.
- Vulnerability to eavesdropping and hacking
- Risk of interference with other electronic devices
- Potential for unwanted and intrusive advertising through audio tracking

### Question 2

The Beneficial effects of my project and one potential harmful effect

#### Beneficial effects 
- increased awareness
- empowerment with essential knowledge
- Entertainment: Random fact generators can be a fun and engaging way to pass the time, with the added bonus of learning something new.

#### Potential Harmful Effect
-   Misinformation - If the facts that I use are not verified before use, it can lead to the spread of misinformation. 

### Question 3
- Yes dopamine issues are real. Companies like instagram and tik tok also use it to keep users engaged and on the app. Even games use it. Instagram uses colors to trigger chemical signals to activate tour dopamine levels which make you feel "good". 
- Something that is impacting my personal study is the use of addictive and attractive color scheme used by apps like instagram to pull in users and keep them on the app for a long time. This causes me loose my productivity and makes me stay up late at night trying to finish all my work.

### Question 4

What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
> The pros of internet blocker are - 
- Increased security: Helps prevent access to potentially harmful websites, protects against malware and other cyber threats.
- Productivity: Reduces distractions and helps students focus on their studies.
- control: Allows school to control what their students can access online.

> the cons of internet blocker are - 
- Limitation of access: May restrict access to important educational websites and resources.
- Inconvenience: Can cause frustration for students and staff if they need to access a website that is blocked.

> pros of lack of admin passwords
- Increased security: Reduces the risk of students installing harmful software or making unauthorized changes to the computer.
- Easy maintenance: IT staff can easily manage and maintain the computers without worrying about students making changes.
- Standardization: All computers are set up the same way, making it easier for teachers and students to use them.

>cons of lack of admin passwords 
- Limited control: Students may be unable to install necessary software or make other changes to their computer. For example CSP students need to get their own computer to school because they are unable to download the software needed on the chromebooks provided by the school
- Lack of personalization: Students may not be able to personalize their computer to meet their specific needs. for different classes and purposes.

## Safe Computing

### Questions
> Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

### Answers
 - Personal identifiable information is present all over my website. The website contains my name, what I like and don't and also links to my personal github account. I am ok with this because this blog is for my school project, so I need teachers and peers to be able to identify that the work on this website is all mine and also that this website is mine.
 - PII are have potential to be very dangerous. But at the same time it is important some times to identify the person and also provide the person with the ability to call something his work. 
 - Bad passwords are those that are very predictable and something that is very simple like "passwords" or "yourname@123". good passwords are complex and unpredictable with a good distribution of characters, numbers nad symbols. something that is very hard to guess. 
 - A symetric encription uses the same key to access data, and allows it so anyone who has the specific key (password) can attain access to the data. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public and a private that are both required to attain the data.

- In AWS deployment we used AES-256 encryption. The data we have on our deployed AWS sites allows it so only shared contributors to our project (via github) can pull, push, and commit changes to the main site. In doing so, we encrypted our project from public use
- I used see all these ads about free things, and one time I clicked on one of them which took me to this website that said that you need to input email to win the product. After doing so nothing actually ever happened, I realized that I was scammed.The account that I gave was a burner so that was ok. Some other strategies are conducting these scams on the older generation, they tell them about some cash back and hack into their computer and steel all money directly from their bank account. 

## Licenses and legal  

### Questions
> - When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.
> - In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.
> - Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.

## Answers

-   There are community licences, MIT Licenses, and GNU GPLv3 Licenses. Community is when you contribute to the project, does not have a dependency MIT is short, straightforward, anyone can do almost anything with the project and make/distribute versions GNU lets people do anything with the project, however they cannot distribute versions of it.

- I prefer to use the MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it. This is something that is needed when working in a school setting where everyone helps each other. 

- Different licenses allow different people to do different things on and with your site/function. These are like patents, and big companies like Qualcomm make money off of them. Opensource management is completely legal for educational use, however if you want to monetise the work that you use/take from a licensed source you will have to attend to the terms of the license. I feel that these licenses can be misleading and can have very restrictive terms.

- For both of the repositories I chose MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it. This is something that is needed when working in a school setting where everyone helps each other.
