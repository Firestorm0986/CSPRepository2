## Night At the Museum -

One night near the end of the trimester where students in art and craft classes can show off their progress and work. Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks.

### 3D Animation:

I have already taken this course and it always astonishes me how creative and amzaning some of these 3D animations can be. I loved the above picture the most due to the attention to detail and the background. Also how it focuses on the donut and the lamp make the art really good and impactful.

The dolphin is my favorite and I also am fasinated by how they sculpt such things in such short amount of time. I love the mugs as well due to the color and design.

these drawings are amazing and I love the snikers one the most because it is my favourite chocolate. The other one looks amazing and pulls you in as you stare at it. These drwaings are something I hope I could also learn to do.
