## Questions

The question in the quiz consisted of various problems containing how a robot will move based upon specific code segments. The other questions consisted of questions that asked theoretical answers and where certain approaches to problems is effective and where it is not. additionally, there were questions that asked about what was wrong in the given code segment and how can it be made better. Most of these questions were straightforward and easy to understand but there were some questions that gave me some trouble because of the confusing answers and questions.

## What I Missed
> I missed 4 questions. Most of them were because i did not pay enough attention to what the question asked. They were silly mistakes. But some of them were confusing and I could not understand what the question was asking for completely.

> in this question I made a silly mistake and selected number 1 because it was looked like the correct answer but I did not see that there was a smaller than equal to sign under 18, which meant that the person could be eighteen and hence this meant the person could vote. This was a silly mistake. 

### Question #27:
This question asks which of the following code segments would code for the movement of the robot as shown.

>In question 27 I had some difficulty understanding the the code segments given,, which led to me making an assumption to which one of them is correct
