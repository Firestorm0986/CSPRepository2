## Screenshot Of Theme Change On Fastpages
I changes the theme of my fastpages to cayman theme. It did not work well and crashed the website.

## Namming and Tagging 
I changed and made new tags for diffrent posts and notebooks according to what I used inside them and which week I made them in. I made a table as well in the home page that contaiins these tags and you can also see them in the Tag's page.

## Using The Search
We can use search to find key elements for easier access. One way to do so is by using the title of the particular post or notebook. If you dont know the title you can also search for the particular post or notebook by searching the particular tag in it. Forexample what you are searching for is Bash related you can search "Python" and you will get the perticular pages with that.
