<h2 id="Pthon-Quiz-metod---1">Pthon Quiz metod - 1<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pthon-Quiz-metod---1"> </a></h2><p>copied from the APCSP repository</p>
<p>This example defines a new function "question_with_response", this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question.</p>
<ul>
<li>response from "question_with_response" is captured in a variable called "rsp"<ul>
<li>return command in function returns msg input by user</li>
<li>assignment to "rsp" is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if command is next command in sequence after "rsp" assignment<ul>
<li>this command contains an expression, rsp == "import" which compare what is typed to the string literal answer</li>
<li>an if expression is evaluated for true or false</li>
<li>true takes branch of code directly under if</li>
<li>false takes branch of code directly under else command</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grand finale of this example is calculating the right/total.</p>
<ul>
<li>question = 3 is defined as number of questions</li>
<li>correct = 0 is defined as running score</li>
<li>correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation</li>
<li>since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string.</li>
<li>final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong</li>
</ul>

if is correct!

<li>The function first prints the ques which is defined in code after the function definition. </li>
<li>Then the variable "correct" is modified to be used outside of the current scope, whit this we can make changes to variable and print the variable in local context.</li>
<li>the variable "input_ans" is attached to the user input for the aswers for the questions.</li>
<li>"if" and "else" statems follow, the if statement prints "You got it right!!" if you get it right. and the else prints "Your answer is wrong" if you answer wrong.  </li>
<li>correct is gven the value 0 becuase score starts from 0 . Correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation. in this that case after the if statement.</li>
