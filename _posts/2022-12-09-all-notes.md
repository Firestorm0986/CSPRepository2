<h2 id="Unit-2">Unit 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Unit-2"> </a></h2><p>Bits - Smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
Bytes - A unit of data that is eight binary digits long
Hexadecimal - A numbering system with base 16
Binary Numbers - A numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit -- 0 or 1 :
Unsigned Integer - Just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them
Signed Integer - Represent both positive and negative numbers
Floating Point - A positive or negative whole number with a decimal point
Binary Data Abstractions - Reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole:
Boolean - A logical data type that can have only the values true or false
ASCII - The most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet
Unicode - Universal character representation standard for text in computer processing
RGB - A system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display
Data Compression - the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size:
Lossy - the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression
Lossless - restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed</p>

<ul>
<li>Variable - A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program</li>
<li>Data types - A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error</li>
<li>Assignment Operation - The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element
Managing Complexity with Variables - Establishes a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level:</li>
<li>Lists - abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once</li>
<li>2D Lists - collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name
Dictionaries - an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs</li>
<li>Class - template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object</li>
<li>Sequence - the order in which the statements are executed</li>
<li>Selection - a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met</li>
<li>Iteration - a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing</li>
<li>Expressions - a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value</li>
<li>Booleans Expressions and Iteration - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE where a process can be repeated</li>
<li>Truth Tables - a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit</li>
<li>Characters - a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol</li>
<li>Strings - a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable</li>
<li>Length - The length of a data type, can be number of characters or number of data</li>
<li>Concatenation - the operation of joining two strings together</li>
<li>Upper - Uppercase characters</li>
<li>Lower - Lowercase characters</li>
<li>Traversing Strings - accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript</li>
<li>Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - Conditionals that occur while a specific process is being repeated - can be stopped or passed</li>
<li>Procedural Abstraction - when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters</li>
<li>Python Def procedures - A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name</li>
<li>Return Values - ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function</li>
</ul>
