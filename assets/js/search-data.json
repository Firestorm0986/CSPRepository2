            "content": "Objectives: . Students will be able to... . Understand the concept of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and 2D arrays | Learn how to iterate through data structures using loops | Able to visualize data structures and iteration processes | Able to apply their knowledge to build simulations/interactions using lists and iteration | Learn how to store list and dictionary content in databases | . Lesson 1: Lists and Iteration . Lists (Ethan) . Lists are a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable | Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] | Each item in a list is separated by a comma | Lists are indexed, starting at 0 | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;] print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Accessing Lists . To access individual items in a list, we use the index of the item. | Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. | . print(fruits[0]) print(fruits[2]) . apple orange . Slicing Lists . We can also extract a specific portion of a list using slicing. | We use the colon : operator to specify a range of indices to include. | . print(fruits[0:2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;] . Modifying List Items . Lists are mutable, meaning that we can change the value of an item in a list. | To change the value of an item in a list, we can use the indexing operator (square brackets) to access the item and then assign a new value to it. | . fruits[2] = &quot;pear&quot; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Adding and Removing List Items . Adding . Use the append() method to add an item to the end of a list. | . fruits.append(&quot;kiwi&quot;) # Adds &#39;kiwi&#39; to the end of the list print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the insert() method to add an item to a specific index in a list. | . fruits.insert(1, &quot;peach&quot;) # Inserts &quot;peach&quot; at index 1 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Removing . Use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of an item from a list. | . fruits.remove(&#39;pear&#39;) # Removes the first occurrence of &#39;pear&#39; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the pop() method to remove the item at a specific index from a list. | . fruits.pop(2) # Removes the item at index 2 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the clear() method to remove all items from a list. | . fruits.clear() # Removes all items from the list print(fruits) . [] . Function Explanation . InsertToList . This function is designed to insert a new item into a list at a specific index. | It first retrieves the new item to be added and the index at which to add it from the HTML document. | It checks if the retrieved values are both valid integers and if the index is within the range of the list. | If the values are valid, the function uses the splice() method to insert the new item into the list at the specified index. | In JavaScript, the splice() method modifies an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. | The splice() method takes three arguments:the index at which to start changing the list, the number of elements to remove, and the new item to add. - The item is inserted without removing any elements, so we pass 0 as the second argument. | Finally, the function calls the visualizeList() function to display the updated list on the web page. | . // Get the value of the new item and the index where it should be inserted function insertToList() { let newItem = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;newItem&quot;).value); let index = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;index&quot;).value); if (!isNaN(newItem) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(index) &amp;&amp; index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= myList.length) { // splice() method to insert the new item into the list myList.splice(index - 1, 0, newItem); // Call the visualizeList() function to update the display of the list visualizeList(); } } . SortList . In JavaScript, sort() is a built-in method used to sort the elements of an array in place. The default sort order is ascending, but you can also specify a descending sort order. | In this case, the function sorts myList in ascending order based on their numerical value. | . // Sort myList array in ascending order function sortList() { // The function a - b is used, which subtracts the second element b from the first element a. // If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is zero, the order of the elements is unchanged. myList.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b); visualizeList(); } . Applications of Lists . Data processing: Lists are commonly used to store and process large amounts of data. In data analysis and machine learning, lists are often used to store datasets. . | Gaming: Lists are used extensively in game development to store game objects, player statistics, and game maps. . | Finance: Lists are used in finance to store and process financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. The data from these lists can also be used to calculate financial metrics and to create financial models. . | . Hacks (0.3) . Make your own list and manipulate it via accessing specific elements, adding or removing elements, etc. | Extra: Make an interactable visualization that can manipulate elements in a list such as the one demonstrated in our flask repository | . Iteration (Alex) . What is iteration? . In programming, iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. This can be achieved using loop structures like for loops and while loops. | . For Loops . A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, string, etc.) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a for loop in Python: | . sequence = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for variable in sequence: print(variable) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . my_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; for character in my_string: print(character) . H e l l o , W o r l d ! . While Loops A while loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a while loop in Python: . num = 0 while num &lt; 5: print(num) num += 1 . 0 1 2 3 4 . Applications of Iteration . Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer programming and is used in a variety of real-life applications. Here are some examples:Data Processing . Data processing often involves iterating over large datasets to perform specific operations on each element. For example, in a data analysis task, you might iterate over a list of numbers to compute the average, or iterate over a list of strings to find the longest string. | . User Interfaces . User interfaces often involve iteration to display and handle data from various sources. For example, in a web application, you might iterate over a list of users to display their information in a table. Similarly, in a desktop application, you might iterate over a list of files to display them in a file explorer. | . Machine Learning . Machine learning algorithms often involve iterative processes to train models and improve their accuracy. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, you might iterate over a set of training data to update the model&#39;s parameters and minimize the loss function. | . Popcorn hack (0.3) . Make a list related to your CPT project | Make a while loop that will print each term in the list | Make a for loop that will print each term in the list | . Simulation mechanics . In Python, pop() is a method that is used to remove and return an element from a list. The syntax for using pop() is as follows: | . my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(my_list) my_list.pop() print(my_list) my_list.pop(1) print(my_list) . [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [1, 2, 3, 4] [1, 3, 4] . In Python, append() is a built-in method that is used to add an element to the end of a list. The syntax for using append() is as follows: . my_list = [] my_list.append(1) my_list.append(2) my_list.append(3) print(my_list) . [1, 2, 3] . Dictionary Lesson / 2D Arrays . Lesson 2: Dictionary&#39;s and 2 Dimensional Arrays . Advay Shindikar and Amay Advani . Objective: . Understand the concept of dictionaries and how they can be applied | Learn how to add, modify, and delete entries in a dictionary using the assignment operator and the del keyword | Understand the concept of 2D arrays and how they can be used to store data in rows and columns | Learn how to create a 2D array in Python using a nested list | Understand how to access values in a 2D array using row and column indices | Learn how to use indexing and slicing to access a subset of a 2D array | . . student = {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Advay&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;Sophomore&#39;} . students = [&#39;advay&#39;, &#39;amay&#39;, &#39;rohin&#39;, &#39;alex&#39;, &#39;ethan&#39;] . . Check In: . Of the above code segments, which is a list and which is a dictionary? The 2nd students is a list and the 1st one is a dictionary. | . | What is a dictionary and how is it used? A dictionary is a 1D array which stores key-value pairs. The keys must be unique to store values. | . | What is a 2D Array? A 2D Array is data structure which uses multiple lists to create a multi-dimensional data structure. The 2D Arrays must have rows and columns. | . | How are 2D Arrays different from 1D Arrays or Lists and what can they be used for? 2D Arrays are different from 1D Arrays or Lists because they require users to input 2 parameters to get a specific value instead of just 1. 2D Arrays can be used for things like games like Tic Tac Toe and representing matrices. | . | . Manipulating Dictionaries . grocery_dict = {} # ask the user to enter grocery items and their prices while True: item = input(&quot;Enter an item for your grocery list (or &#39;done&#39; to exit): &quot;) if item == &quot;done&quot;: break else: price = float(input(&quot;Enter the price of {}: &quot;.format(item))) grocery_dict[item] = price # print the grocery list and total cost total_cost = 0 while True: print(&quot;Your grocery list:&quot;) for item, price in grocery_dict.items(): print(&quot;- {}: ${}&quot;.format(item, price)) print(&quot;Total cost: ${}&quot;.format(total_cost)) # ask the user to choose an action action = input(&quot;What would you like to do?

Lesson Portion 1: ReIntroduction to Data Analysis, NunPy, and Pandas, Why is it important? . Data Analysis. . Data Analysis is the process of examining data sets in order to find trends and draw conclusions about the given information. Data analysis is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances. | . What is NunPy and Pandas . Pandas library involves a lot of data analysis in Python. NumPy Library is mostly used for working with numerical values and it makes it easy to apply with mathematical functions. | Imagine you have a lot of toys, but they are all mixed up in a big box. NumPy helps you to put all the same types of toys together, like all the cars in one pile and all the dolls in another. Pandas is like a helper that helps you to remember where each toy is located. So, if you want to find a specific toy, like a red car, you can ask Pandas to find it for you. | Just like how it&#39;s easier to find a toy when they are sorted and organized, it&#39;s easier for grown-ups to understand and analyze big sets of numbers when they use NumPy and Pandas. | .

In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. .

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a _Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # The output is inside curly brackets and # took out duplicate values # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # both cannot have duplicates . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . Programmers should care about space and time complexity to make their code more effective. Decreasing the time and space helps decrease the resourses | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk. The first code block is the original image. In the second code block, change the baseWidth to rescale the image. . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: lassen_volcano = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) image_display(lassen_volcano) . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image as pilImage from io import BytesIO import base64 # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def scale_image(img): #baseWidth = 625 #baseWidth = 1250 #baseWidth = 2500 baseWidth = 5000 # see the effect of doubling or halfing the baseWidth baseWidth = 10000 baseWidth = 20000 baseWidth = 40000 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;width&#39;], image[&#39;height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;width&#39;] * image[&#39;height&#39;] # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;], image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;] * image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data(images = [{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . space complexity as we changed the size of the image. We increased the pixels but at the same time this is also a time complexity as space and time are related to each other. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) print(numbers) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(34)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n).

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | The code for this create is much shorter. It requires the conn and cursor objects to be opened and closed. The cursor must execute a code which takes all of the variables and adds it to the table. | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | SQL INSERT allows rows to be added to an SQL database table. The User init function allows a dataset which is defined to be able to added to an SQL database. This serves a similar purpose. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | The hacked part of the update function outputs a message to the user if the length of the password is too short. This serves as authentication for the user to make sure that a password is long enough for security purposes. | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code. | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily. | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | DELETE can be a dangerous operation because it can remove information from the database, and if placed in the wrong hands, they could delete important information by accident. However, delete is also necessary in order to maintain a clean database with proper records. | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | In the print statements, the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} allow the coder to include the selected uid without having to add multiple strings in the print statement. It allows for easy replacement and making a statement which uses the variable which the user called for. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | recurrsionm it keeps itself running as there is nor return fucntion or break fuction to stoop the loop | Could you refactor this menu?

In the FOR EACH loop, when the value of name is &quot;Andrea&quot;, the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. When the value of name is &quot;Ben&quot;, the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 1. But as the loop continues, and the value of name is &quot;Chris&quot;, the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. The procedure displays 0, even though the correct answer is 1. | The one that I chose displays the correct index value. I forgot about the third loop will change the index number again. | . Wrong Question 2 . Explanation . Program documentation is written throughout the development process, and it should be modified as the program is written and modified. Since programs are often modified after they are first written, the documentation should be modified as well. | The correct answers - During initial program development, documentation can allow the writer to organize his or her thinking, state assumptions about input, and explain the path of future development. When modifications are made to existing programs, documentation is used to record the changes or additions to an existing program. | . Wrong Question 3 . Explanation . The fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. | The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of (NOT (a OR b)) AND c to a. Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false. The last three statements display the values of the variables. | . Wrong Question 4 . Explanation . The values can be stored in any numerical base as long as they are sorted. | In order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted. | . Wrong Question 5 . Explanation . A binary search will work on any sorted list, regardless of whether the list contains duplicate elements. | Correct. In order for a binary search on a list to work, the elements of the list must be sorted. | . Wrong Question 6 . Explanation . I read the firsst of the question wrong | .",

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab It is important to know the file type of the image file, such as PNG or JPG, as different file types have different compression techniques and levels of compression | . | Size, height and width, number of pixels Size, height and width, number of pixels:The size of an image file is measured in terms of the number of pixels it contains, which is determined by its height and width.&gt; - The more pixels an image has, the larger its file size will be. It is important to consider the size of the image file as it can affect the loading time of the image. | . | Visual perception, lossy compression When compressing image files, it is important to consider how the compression will affect the visual quality of the image. Lossy compression techniques, which reduce file size by discarding some of the image data, can result in a loss of visual quality that may be noticeable to the human eye. | Data compression is the process of reducing the size of an image file by removing or compressing redundant information. | . | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | ls - list the contents of the current directory, cd - change directory to a specified location, pwd - print the current working directory, mkdir - create a new directory, rm - remove a file or directory, cp - copy a file or directory, mv - move a file or directory | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? | dir - list the contents of the current directory cd - change directory to a specified location cd.. - move up one directory level md - create a new directory rd - remove a directory copy - copy a file or directory move - move a file or directory | What are some of the major differences? | One of the major differences between the two sets of commands is the syntax used. In Linux/Unix, commands and file paths are typically separated by forward slashes, while in Windows, they are separated by backslashes. | Additionally, Linux/Unix commands are often shorter and more concise, using single-letter flags to modify their behavior, while Windows commands are often longer and more descriptive, using full words and phrases to specify options and parameters. Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. | Why is path a big deal when working with images? | `Path is a big deal when working with images because it allows the software or application to locate the image file on the computer or network. Without the correct path, the software or application will not be able to find and display the image. This is particularly important when working with images in programming, where the path is specified in code and needs to be accurate. | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | The metadata source and label are important in Unit 5 topics, particularly in the context of supervised learning. Metadata such as image dimensions, file type, and compression type can provide useful information about the image and help in preprocessing and feature extraction. | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | IPython is an interactive command-line shell for Python that provides enhanced functionality, such as tab completion, object introspection, and inline plotting. It is particularly useful in Jupyter Notebooks, where it allows for interactive exploration and analysis of data. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . converts binary encoded data into an encoded scheme of 24 bits and 6 base64 bits. It is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS | Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | YWRP how to do it is shown below | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | When I am trying to download a large pdf file like a textbook. | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | My computer lags and so does my cursor. some dites do not function and many time I have seen that the whole computer just still | How do these effects apply to images? | Yes | . import base64 # Encode the string &quot;adi&quot; to base64 string_to_encode = &quot;adi&quot; encoded_string = base64.b64encode(string_to_encode.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)).decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) print(encoded_string) . YWRp . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | Ye, especially for the greay scale, where the RGB values are strategically converted to a grey shade or tone in steps | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | A grayscale algorithm converts a color image into a black and white image by removing the color information and retaining only the luminance or brightness values of each pixel. The algorithm works as follows:Load the color image into memory. Iterate through each pixel of the image. For each pixel, calculate the grayscale value using the formula: grayscale = (0.299 red) + (0.587 green) + (0.114 * blue) where red, green, and blue are the color values of the pixel. Assign the calculated grayscale value to the pixel. Save the grayscale image to disk.- Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? | A scaled image is an image that has been resized to either be smaller or larger than its original size. Scaling an image involves changing the number of pixels that make up the image, which can affect its overall quality and clarity | When scaling an image to be larger, new pixels are added to the image to increase its size. Conversely, when scaling an image to be smaller, some of the original pixels are removed or combined to decrease its size. | The first image is scaled up, the second stays the same and the third is scaled down | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? | Scaling an image is not considered a type of compression because it does not involve any reduction in the file size of the image. When an image is compressed, the file size is reduced by either removing some of the data or by encoding the data in a more efficient way. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Aditya Nawandhar&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smiley face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smiley-face.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

Look at PIL library and see if there are other things that can be done. | There are many effects you can do as well with PIL. Blur the image or write Meta Data on screen, aka Title, Author and Image size. | . Lossy . Lossy compression algorithms work by discarding some of the information from the original data to reduce its size. As a result, they are best suited for images with lots of redundant or irrelevant information that can be safely removed without affecting the overall quality. For example, a photograph with complex color variations and gradients may be more difficult to compress losslessly because each pixel contains a unique color value that contributes to the overall visual effect. Removing some of this information may result in a noticeable loss of quality, but if the compression algorithm is smart enough, it can discard some of the less important details to reduce the file size without too much visible degradation. | . Lossless . On the other hand, lossless compression algorithms aim to reduce the file size without losing any information from the original data. They work best for images with simple structures and patterns, such as line drawings, logos, and graphics. In these cases, the compression algorithm can take advantage of the regularity of the data to encode it more efficiently, without discarding any pixels or color values. As a result, the compressed image will look identical to the original, but with a smaller file size. | .",

But this is very inefficient way of iteration and processing of data, it will also make it harder to manipulate the data. Also, makes it harder to add new data as a new unique variable needs to be made each time. | . Procedural Abstraction . Code segment 3- A function that calls the list and uses the random library to select a random fact from the api or list of facts and returns the selected fact. The parameter is the list of facts. | code segment 4 - the function being called in the frontend of the program using javascript. . | The function calls the list of facts and uses the random library to select a random fact from the api or list of facts and returns the selected fact. The parameter here is the list of facts. | . Algorithm Implementation . The same code segment as above which will show that the function randomly iterates through the list and selects a random fact from the list. This maybe done by using the random library to select a random number from the length of the list and then using that number as the index value for the list and using the corresponding fact. | ** I will write a more detailed description of the code once the code is ready ** | . Testing . Have not yet decide on how the testing will proceed but will likely be using a combination of the user clicking generate button or by putting the value car or industry in a input box. | . Video plan . The generate button is clicked a random fact is generated or the word “car” or “industry” is clicked and a random fact about either topic in electric car theme is selected . Beneficial effects . increased awareness | empowerment with essential knowledge | Entertainment: Random fact generators can be a fun and engaging way to pass the time, with the added bonus of learning something new. | . Potential Harmful Effect . Misinformation - If the facts that I use are not verified before use, it can lead to the spread of misinformation. | .",

            "content": "Digital Divide . Question 1 . Some one can empower themselves in this digital world is by | Learn about online privacy and security | Take control of personal data | Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication | Keep software and devices up to date | Be cautious with email and avoid phishing scams | Limit personal information shared online | Use reliable sources for information | Understand digital rights and laws. | . Question 2 . Someone who is already empowered and has technology that is needed in this digital world can give away their used devices and help someone not empowered buy products that are essential for them to function in this world. We can create Gofund me to build money for someone who needs financial aid. We can as I said before give away used devices. We can also - | Share knowledge and resources on digital literacy | Mentor or tutor individuals in technology skills | Collaborate on community projects that promote digital inclusion | Advocate for policies that support digital equity | Organize workshops or events to raise awareness on digital empowerment | . Question 3 . Yes, there is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment. But the extent of such red tapes is based upon the location and context. . Some countries have red tapes like laws and regulations that limit the access to certain technology. Unequal digital infrastructure can put some countries above others in terms of digital empowerment. | In Del Norte High school, because of the high school being a public school they lack enough funding to empower every student equally. | . . Beneficial and Harmful effects . Question 1 . Product - Live microphone in mobile phones Benefits: . Improved voice quality during calls | Enhanced accessibility for users with disabilities | Hands-free operation for multitasking | Increased efficiency in virtual meetings or conference calls | Improved voice recognition for personal assistants like Siri or Google Assistant | Enhanced audio recording capabilities for journalists or content creators | Improved quality of voice-activated commands in games or other applications. | . Harmful effects: . Privacy concerns with unintentional audio recording | Increased background noise and interference | Increased battery drain due to constant microphone usage. | Vulnerability to eavesdropping and hacking | Risk of interference with other electronic devices | Potential for unwanted and intrusive advertising through audio tracking | Loss of control over personal information and data through audio data collection and analysis. | . . Question 2 . The Beneficial effects of my project and one potential harmful effect . Beneficial effects . increased awareness | empowerment with essential knowledge | Entertainment: Random fact generators can be a fun and engaging way to pass the time, with the added bonus of learning something new. | . Potential Harmful Effect . Misinformation - If the facts that I use are not verified before use, it can lead to the spread of misinformation. | . Question 3 . Yes dopamine issues are real. Companies like instagram and tik tok also use it to keep users engaged and on the app. Even games use it. Instagram uses colors to trigger chemical signals to activate tour dopamine levels which make you feel “good”. | Something that is impacting my personal study is the use of addictive and attractive color scheme used by apps like instagram to pull in users and keep them on the app for a long time. This causes me loose my productivity and makes me stay up late at night trying to finish all my work. | . . Question 4 . What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . The pros of internet blocker are - . Increased security: Helps prevent access to potentially harmful websites, protects against malware and other cyber threats. | Productivity: Reduces distractions and helps students focus on their studies. | control: Allows school to control what their students can access online. | . the cons of internet blocker are - . Limitation of access: May restrict access to important educational websites and resources. | Inconvenience: Can cause frustration for students and staff if they need to access a website that is blocked. | . pros of lack of admin passwords . Increased security: Reduces the risk of students installing harmful software or making unauthorized changes to the computer. | Easy maintenance: IT staff can easily manage and maintain the computers without worrying about students making changes. | Standardization: All computers are set up the same way, making it easier for teachers and students to use them. | . cons of lack of admin passwords . Limited control: Students may be unable to install necessary software or make other changes to their computer. For example CSP students need to get their own computer to school because they are unable to download the software needed on the chromebooks provided by the school | Lack of personalization: Students may not be able to personalize their computer to meet their specific needs. for different classes and purposes. | . . Safe Computing . Questions . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . Answers . Personal identifiable information is present all over my website. The website contains my name, what I like and don’t and also links to my personal github account. I am ok with this because this blog is for my school project, so I need teachers and peers to be able to identify that the work on this website is all mine and also that this website is mine. | PII are have potential to be very dangerous. But at the same time it is important some times to identify the person and also provide the person with the ability to call something his work. | Bad passwords are those that are very predictable and something that is very simple like “passwords” or “yourname@123”. good passwords are complex and unpredictable with a good distribution of characters, numbers nad symbols. something that is very hard to guess. | A symetric encription uses the same key to access data, and allows it so anyone who has the specific key (password) can attain access to the data. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public and a private that are both required to attain the data. | In AWS deployment we used AES-256 encryption. The data we have on our deployed AWS sites allows it so only shared contributors to our project (via github) can pull, push, and commit changes to the main site. In doing so, we encrypted our project from public use | I used see all these ads about free things, and one time I clicked on one of them which took me to this website that said that you need to input email to win the product. After doing so nothing actually ever happened, I realized that I was scammed.The account that I gave was a burner so that was ok. Some other strategies are conducting these scams on the older generation, they tell them about some cash back and hack into their computer and steel all money directly from their bank account. | . Licenses and legal . Questions . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | . Answers . There are community licences, MIT Licenses, and GNU GPLv3 Licenses. Community is when you contribute to the project, does not have a dependency MIT is short, straightforward, anyone can do almost anything with the project and make/distribute versions GNU lets people do anything with the project, however they cannot distribute versions of it. . | I prefer to use the MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it. This is something that is needed when working in a school setting where everyone helps each other. . | Different licenses allow different people to do different things on and with your site/function. These are like patents, and big companies like Qualcomm make money off of them. Opensource management is completely legal for educational use, however if you want to monetise the work that you use/take from a licensed source you will have to attend to the terms of the license. I feel that these licenses can be misleading and can have very restrictive terms. . | For both of the repositories I chose MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it. This is something that is needed when working in a school setting where everyone helps each other. . | .",

TERMS for my refrence . Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .",

Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer if the number is even, divide by 2 if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 .

ALL Notes for the lesson . Lists are a good way to organize and collect data in a program, as they allow a set of potentially very different items to be found within one object. | They are a collection of data | Items in lists are located with indexes, which, in most code languages, start with 0 (though the pseudocode used by CollegeBoard usually starts at 1!). | Using functions like append(), pop(), and insert(), you can add new things to a list or remove them. | Various inbuilt functions help with performing taskes on lists. .append() and others | Keeping items within lists allow you to apply a function to each item of a list using iteration. | Iteration is the repetition of a function. Loops can be used to do this | for loops - These loops are good for applying a certain alogrithm or function to an entire list of similar things. However, how many times the function iterates is not as controllable. | Recursive loops can be created in multiple different ways, and involve incrementing a variable until it reaches a certain break point. | While loops don&#39;t require a function that is then called again within the original function until a condition is met. | . grocery_list = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;] print(grocery_list[3]) y = grocery_list[3] print(y) grocery_list.append(&quot;artichokes&quot;) grocery_list.append(&quot;umbrellas&quot;) print(grocery_list) grocery_list.insert(2, &quot;eggs&quot;) print(grocery_list) grocery_list.remove(grocery_list[1]) print(grocery_list) grocery_list[2]= &quot;artichokes&quot; print(grocery_list) . carrots carrots [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] . def numberTobinary(y): return int(y, 2) binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] new_list = [] for i in binarylist: if numberTobinary(i) &lt; 100: new_list.append(i) print(&quot;binary to number conversion is: &quot;, numberTobinary(i)) print(new_list) pass print(new_list) #when done, print the results . binary to number conversion is: 73 [&#39;01001001&#39;] binary to number conversion is: 55 [&#39;01001001&#39;, &#39;00110111&#39;] [&#39;01001001&#39;, &#39;00110111&#39;] .

Vocab: fill in the blanks using the video . Index is a number representing a position, like a character&#39;s position in a string or a string&#39;s position in a list. Concatenation is - Concatenating means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings. Length is - it can return the number of items in a list. You can use the function with many different data types. A substring is - A substring is a subset or part of another string, or it is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string . Substring/Length Practice: change the print functions to print &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;bye&quot;, and the string length . #the substring will have the characters including the index &quot;start&quot; to the character BEFORE the index &quot;end&quot; #len(string) will print the length of string string = &quot;hellobye&quot; print(len(string)) print(string[0:5]) print(string[5:8]) . 8 hello bye . Concatenation Practice: combine string1 and string2 to make string3, then print string3. . string1 = &quot;computer&quot; string2 = &quot;science&quot; string3 = string1 + &quot; &quot; + string2 print(string3) . computer science . Homework/List Adaptation: create a function that prints the name of each string in the list and the string&#39;s length. Challenge: add frontend with javascript or html. . names = [&quot;jaden&quot;,&quot;max&quot;,&quot;dylan&quot;,&quot;orlando&quot;] def length(list): for i in names: print(len(i), i) length(names) . 5 jaden 3 max 5 dylan 7 orlando . Notes . substring is part of a string | pseudocode is explaining what the code will do. Helps others understand the code | Pseudocode is writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts. | suntax for substring is print(string[start:end]) | index is the position of each character or element inside a object (can be string, number, list dictionary) | .",

Data abstraction provides a seperation between the abstract properties of a data ype and the concrete details of its representation | data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without refrencing the specific etails of the representation | Data Abstraction makes it easier to implement, develop and maintain code easier | The ue of lists allows for multiple related values to be treated as a single value | In AP exam the index values for lists start rom 1 and not 0 like in python. | . Using simple lists and working with variables . Lists are a powerful tool that can be used to organise, maintain and develoop related data | For example - A list of students in a class, if there was no list we would assign a variable to each student but if the data was in a list everyone would be under one variable. If a student left the class or was added instead of deleting entire variable we can edit the previous list. | this helps organize data and make less mistakes | . shopping_list = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;rice&quot; ] # list syntax is &quot;[]&quot; another_list = shopping_list print(id(shopping_list)) # each object has a uniques id; the id() function returns this id for the specifies object print(id(another_list)) # As shopping_list is attritibuted to another_list, the id for both are the same as the object in questiom does not change print(another_list) shopping_list += [&quot;cookies&quot;] # adding cookies to the list print(shopping_list) print(id(shopping_list)) # the id does not change print(another_list) a = b = c = d = e = f = another_list # it is possibe to atrribute the same object to various variables print(a) print(&quot;Adding cream&quot;) # .append() is a function which can be used to place new items into old lists b.append(&quot;cream&quot;) # changes in one of the variables chnges all the lists in other as the object in question is the same. print(a) print(c) print(d) . 139939430214464 139939430214464 [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] 139939430214464 [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] Adding cream [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] .

In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks. . . 3D Animation: . . I have already taken this course and it always astonishes me how creative and amzaning some of these 3D animations can be. I loved the above picture the most due to the attention to detail and the background. Also how it focuses on the donut and the lamp make the art really good and impactful. . . ceramics: . . The dolphin is my favorite and I also am fasinated by how they sculpt such things in such short amount of time. I love the mugs as well due to the color and design. . . Studio Art: . . . these drawings are amazing and I love the snikers one the most because it is my favourite chocolate. The other one looks amazing and pulls you in as you stare at it.

Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by Brainstorming (draw on investigation) | Storyboarding the program | Planning user experience | Laying out the user interface | Organizing into modules | Develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that Describe how a program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the Micro level | Macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | Efficiency of overall programming process | Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | Programmers’ response to bugs | . . Final Project Design . Idea/Brain Write . A random quiz generator. Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted. Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user’s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .

This project is also going to hold team members’ interest for 8 weeks because this project can always be improved - whether it be the ideas behind it or the code running the program - and the code will also take time to be finished. This project is pretty complex - not so much that we are uninterested or demotivated - but enough so that we can’t finish it in just a few days. . This project can be used by people beyond the 8 weeks. This program is built so that people can use it. Whenever people input in notes, those notes will be saved and quiz questions will also be generated based on those notes (i.e, Customer Needed). . This project has potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission because it fits the criteria for the collegeboard submission.

This example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finale of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hello, adityanav running /bin/python3 You will be asked 3 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test?

Question: What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! adityanav you scored 3/3 . Python Quiz Method - 2 . In this example a new function is defined &quot;quiz&quot; and then after the parameters of the function are defined. Lastly the code prints the score from the quiz. . The parameters of the function are &quot;que&quot; and &quot;ans&quot;. | The function first prints the ques which is defined in code after the function definition. | Then the variable &quot;correct&quot; is modified to be used outside of the current scope, whit this we can make changes to variable and print the variable in local context. | the variable &quot;input_ans&quot; is attached to the user input for the aswers for the questions. | &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; statems follow, the if statement prints &quot;You got it right!!&quot; if you get it right. and the else prints &quot;Your answer is wrong&quot; if you answer wrong. | correct is gven the value 0 becuase score starts from 0 . Correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation. in this that case after the if statement. | the Function is now defined | . After the function gets defined . a variable questions is given the value of the number of questions present in the question | After this the function parameters are defined with the questions and answers | Last line of code is to print the score | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong. | . correct = 0 def quiz(ques, ans): print(ques) global correct #global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope input_ans = input(&quot;Answer: &quot;) # user input if ans == input_ans: # if the answer provided is correct print(&quot;You got it right!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: # if the answer provided is wrong print(&quot;Your answer was wrong&quot;) questions = 4 # number of questions quiz(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;, &quot;import&quot;) # defining the quiz function parameters quiz(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;, &quot;if&quot;) quiz(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;) quiz(&quot;Variables for the values the function needs.

Correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation. in this that case after the if statement. . Then the question and their corresponding answers are put in a dictionary. one question and it&#39;s answer is one value in the dictionary. . After that a for statement is made for the two things in one value in the dictionarie to go through the code blelow until the leght of the dictionary finishes. . the .items commnad itterates over every value in the dictionary | we then use the &quot;question_with_response&quot; function to print the questions for the quiz and the parameter of this function is tied to question variable that connects to the dictionary. | &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; statems follow, the if statement prints &quot;You got it right!!&quot; if you get it right. and the else prints &quot;Your answer is wrong&quot; if you answer wrong. | .

Explain how you know using the data you found. . | The precision of the meterstick used is to the 100th of a cm. I know this because I measured exactly to the last millimeter (10th’s place) and then used the 2-5-8 rule for the last uncertain digit (100th’s place) .

Formula:y= 0.012463x^2 + 0.053317-0.099991 . Graph #2- Linearized Graph (Radius)^2 vs Mass . . This is a linearized graph with radius squared(cm^2)(x-axis) and mass(g)(y-axis). . How did we linearize our graph? From the original table , we squared the radius and kept the mass same because we found that the original graph of non-linearized data looked very similar to a parabola and so figured out that, if we square the radius, the graph becomes linearized. . Formula: y=0.018138x . Analysis Questions - . 1) What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . Radius . | . 2) What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? . The slope represents - density [kg/m^3]; Height/thickness [m]; pie . | . Provide evidence using the dimensions from the known equation and your slope. . . | . 3) Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Consider what theoretically happen if mass or radius is 0. . Yes. The “b” in the formula y = mx + b should be zero. . | the mass of a disk should equal 0 when r2 or r equals 0. . | . 4) Use your linear equation to determine the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Calculate the percent difference between this value and the known density of aluminum. . ( frac{m}{r^{2}} = rho pi h rightarrow 0.018138 lbrack frac{g}{cm^{2}} rbrack = rho3.140.0038 lbrack cm rbrack Rightarrow rho = frac{0.018138}{3.14*0.0038} lbrack frac{g}{cm^{3}} rbrack approx 1.805 frac{g}{cm^{3}}) . | ( rho = frac{m}{r^{2} pi h}) . | So the value of rho for density of aluminum to be 1.805( frac{g}{cm^{3}}). . | The actual value of density of aluminum according to google is - 2.7( frac{g}{cm^{3}}) ; So my percent of error is - 33% . | . 5) Source of errors for the experimental density of aluminum. Make sure you explain what would cause your number to be bigger or smaller than the know value . One of the sources of errors for the experimental density of aluminum is that the disks are not proper circles causing the radius measurements to be incorrect. The radius is inversely proportional to density, so increase in the radius causes a decrease in the density value and vice versa. Added to this is that the disks were folded alot and hence caused incorrect calculations of mass. Mass is directly proportional to density and hence a decrease in the mass causes a decrease in the density and vice versa. All this also could have led to the incorrect calculations of the height, as we calculated the height with the equation hence if the mass is incorrectly recorded then so is the height incorrect. . | . Synthesis Questions - . 1. In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . If we used a greater thickness for the disks then my slope would have been greater as the slope = ( rho pi h) height is directly proportional to the slope and an increase in height will cause an increase in slope. . | Yes, My experimental value for density would have been the same. This is because increasing the thickness would increase in the mass and this will in turn cause the ratio between them to be the same no matter the height. ( rho = frac{m}{r^{2} pi h}) . Hence the density will not change. . | . 2. How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . This change will cause the slope to become even steeper than that of the aluminum graph. This is because the density of steel is greater than the density of aluminum. . | . | 3. Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; | . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to . 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the . density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what . material their disks are made of. . Slope = 122 Kg/m^2 or 12.2 . | Thickness = 0.5 cm or 0.005m . | (slope = rho pi h); so 122 = ( rho)*3.14*0.005 . | ( rho) = 7770.7 Kg/m^3 or 7.77 ( lbrack frac{g}{cm^{3}} rbrack) . | This density value is most similar to the density of iron. So it can be concluded that the disks were made out of iron. . | . Multiple Choice Questions - . 1) &gt; Ans - E. ( frac{h rho}{4 pi}) . 2) &gt; Ans - B . 3) &gt; Ans - C. (r^{3}) .",

Another way to update your repository is by doing it in the power shell. to do this first cd into your cloned repository and then run the command &quot;git add .&quot; after that you run the command git commit -m &quot;your commit message&quot;. This commits your changes after doing so we run the command &quot;git push&quot;, it will prompt you to authenticate yourself and once that is done the repository gets updated. | . | Scripts can be written to automate a procedure from installation. . | . .
