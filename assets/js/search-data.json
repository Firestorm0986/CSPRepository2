            "content": "Enumerate &quot;Data&quot; Big Idea from College Board . Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. . Clouds Impression | Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. .

Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | How do these effects apply to images? | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | Describe scale image?

This helps the user to empower themselves with the necessary knowledge about electric cars and make sound and informed decisions. | The functionality of the program as demonstrated in the video is that a user will press the generate button which will cause a random fact “x” to be generated and displayed on the screen below the button. | The input is the user clicking the generate button. The output is a random fact being generated. | . Data Abstraction . First code segment - One of the code segments will show random facts being stored in a list or dictionary. | second code segment - This data of collection of facts will be then extracted by a function that gets called when the user presses the genrate button | The variable name of the list will be - rand_facts | The data in the list is representing facts about electric cars | . Managing Complexity . The list of facts will be the list used to show that a list is being used to manage complexity. | The list that is being used to manage complexity could be written differently is by assigning each fact a unique variable. But this is very inefficient way of iteration and processing of data, it will also make it harder to manipulate the data. Also, makes it harder to add new data as a new unique variable needs to be made each time. | . Procedural Abstraction . Code segment 3- A function that calls the list and uses the random library to select a random fact from the api or list of facts and returns the selected fact. The parameter is the list of facts. | code segment 4 - the function being called in the frontend of the program using javascript. . | The function calls the list of facts and uses the random library to select a random fact from the api or list of facts and returns the selected fact. The parameter here is the list of facts. | . Algorithm Implementation . The same code segment as above which will show that the function randomly iterates through the list and selects a random fact from the list. This maybe done by using the random library to select a random number from the length of the list and then using that number as the index value for the list and using the corresponding fact. | ** I will write a more detailed description of the code once the code is ready ** | .

Instagram uses colors to trigger chemical signals to activate tour dopamine levels which make you feel “good”. | Something that is impacting my personal study is the use of addictive and attractive color scheme used by apps like instagram to pull in users and keep them on the app for a long time. This causes me loose my productivity and makes me stay up late at night trying to finish all my work. | . . Question 4 . What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . The pros of internet blocker are - . Increased security: Helps prevent access to potentially harmful websites, protects against malware and other cyber threats. | Productivity: Reduces distractions and helps students focus on their studies. | control: Allows school to control what their students can access online. | . the cons of internet blocker are - . Limitation of access: May restrict access to important educational websites and resources. | Inconvenience: Can cause frustration for students and staff if they need to access a website that is blocked. | . pros of lack of admin passwords . Increased security: Reduces the risk of students installing harmful software or making unauthorized changes to the computer. | Easy maintenance: IT staff can easily manage and maintain the computers without worrying about students making changes. | Standardization: All computers are set up the same way, making it easier for teachers and students to use them. | . cons of lack of admin passwords . Limited control: Students may be unable to install necessary software or make other changes to their computer. For example CSP students need to get their own computer to school because they are unable to download the software needed on the chromebooks provided by the school | Lack of personalization: Students may not be able to personalize their computer to meet their specific needs. for different classes and purposes. | . . Safe Computing . Questions . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . Answers . Personal identifiable information is present all over my website. The website contains my name, what I like and don’t and also links to my personal github account. I am ok with this because this blog is for my school project, so I need teachers and peers to be able to identify that the work on this website is all mine and also that this website is mine. | PII are have potential to be very dangerous. But at the same time it is important some times to identify the person and also provide the person with the ability to call something his work. | Bad passwords are those that are very predictable and something that is very simple like “passwords” or “yourname@123”. good passwords are complex and unpredictable with a good distribution of characters, numbers nad symbols. something that is very hard to guess. | A symetric encription uses the same key to access data, and allows it so anyone who has the specific key (password) can attain access to the data. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public and a private that are both required to attain the data. | In AWS deployment we used AES-256 encryption. The data we have on our deployed AWS sites allows it so only shared contributors to our project (via github) can pull, push, and commit changes to the main site. In doing so, we encrypted our project from public use | I used see all these ads about free things, and one time I clicked on one of them which took me to this website that said that you need to input email to win the product. After doing so nothing actually ever happened, I realized that I was scammed.The account that I gave was a burner so that was ok. Some other strategies are conducting these scams on the older generation, they tell them about some cash back and hack into their computer and steel all money directly from their bank account. | . Licenses and legal . Questions . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | . Answers . There are community licences, MIT Licenses, and GNU GPLv3 Licenses. Community is when you contribute to the project, does not have a dependency MIT is short, straightforward, anyone can do almost anything with the project and make/distribute versions GNU lets people do anything with the project, however they cannot distribute versions of it. . | I prefer to use the MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it. This is something that is needed when working in a school setting where everyone helps each other. . | Different licenses allow different people to do different things on and with your site/function. These are like patents, and big companies like Qualcomm make money off of them. Opensource management is completely legal for educational use, however if you want to monetise the work that you use/take from a licensed source you will have to attend to the terms of the license. I feel that these licenses can be misleading and can have very restrictive terms. . | For both of the repositories I chose MIT license, the reason being it has the least amount of restrictions and also allows people to use my code without restriction and reference and distribute it.

TERMS for my refrence . Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .",

ALL Notes for the lesson . Lists are a good way to organize and collect data in a program, as they allow a set of potentially very different items to be found within one object. | They are a collection of data | Items in lists are located with indexes, which, in most code languages, start with 0 (though the pseudocode used by CollegeBoard usually starts at 1!). | Using functions like append(), pop(), and insert(), you can add new things to a list or remove them. | Various inbuilt functions help with performing taskes on lists. .append() and others | Keeping items within lists allow you to apply a function to each item of a list using iteration. | Iteration is the repetition of a function. Loops can be used to do this | for loops - These loops are good for applying a certain alogrithm or function to an entire list of similar things. However, how many times the function iterates is not as controllable. | Recursive loops can be created in multiple different ways, and involve incrementing a variable until it reaches a certain break point. | While loops don&#39;t require a function that is then called again within the original function until a condition is met. | . grocery_list = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;] print(grocery_list[3]) y = grocery_list[3] print(y) grocery_list.append(&quot;artichokes&quot;) grocery_list.append(&quot;umbrellas&quot;) print(grocery_list) grocery_list.insert(2, &quot;eggs&quot;) print(grocery_list) grocery_list.remove(grocery_list[1]) print(grocery_list) grocery_list[2]= &quot;artichokes&quot; print(grocery_list) . carrots carrots [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;carrots&#39;, &#39;cucumbers&#39;, &#39;artichokes&#39;, &#39;umbrellas&#39;] . def numberTobinary(y): return int(y, 2) binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] new_list = [] for i in binarylist: if numberTobinary(i) &lt; 100: new_list.append(i) print(&quot;binary to number conversion is: &quot;, numberTobinary(i)) print(new_list) pass print(new_list) #when done, print the results . binary to number conversion is: 73 [&#39;01001001&#39;] binary to number conversion is: 55 [&#39;01001001&#39;, &#39;00110111&#39;] [&#39;01001001&#39;, &#39;00110111&#39;] .

Vocab: fill in the blanks using the video . Index is a number representing a position, like a character&#39;s position in a string or a string&#39;s position in a list. Concatenation is - Concatenating means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings. Length is - it can return the number of items in a list. You can use the function with many different data types. A substring is - A substring is a subset or part of another string, or it is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string . Substring/Length Practice: change the print functions to print &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;bye&quot;, and the string length . #the substring will have the characters including the index &quot;start&quot; to the character BEFORE the index &quot;end&quot; #len(string) will print the length of string string = &quot;hellobye&quot; print(len(string)) print(string[0:5]) print(string[5:8]) . 8 hello bye . Concatenation Practice: combine string1 and string2 to make string3, then print string3. . string1 = &quot;computer&quot; string2 = &quot;science&quot; string3 = string1 + &quot; &quot; + string2 print(string3) . computer science . Homework/List Adaptation: create a function that prints the name of each string in the list and the string&#39;s length. Challenge: add frontend with javascript or html. . names = [&quot;jaden&quot;,&quot;max&quot;,&quot;dylan&quot;,&quot;orlando&quot;] def length(list): for i in names: print(len(i), i) length(names) . 5 jaden 3 max 5 dylan 7 orlando . Notes . substring is part of a string | pseudocode is explaining what the code will do. Helps others understand the code | Pseudocode is writing out a program in plain language with keywords that are used to refer to common coding concepts. | suntax for substring is print(string[start:end]) | index is the position of each character or element inside a object (can be string, number, list dictionary) | .",

Data abstraction provides a seperation between the abstract properties of a data ype and the concrete details of its representation | data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without refrencing the specific etails of the representation | Data Abstraction makes it easier to implement, develop and maintain code easier | The ue of lists allows for multiple related values to be treated as a single value | In AP exam the index values for lists start rom 1 and not 0 like in python. | . Using simple lists and working with variables . Lists are a powerful tool that can be used to organise, maintain and develoop related data | For example - A list of students in a class, if there was no list we would assign a variable to each student but if the data was in a list everyone would be under one variable. If a student left the class or was added instead of deleting entire variable we can edit the previous list. | this helps organize data and make less mistakes | . shopping_list = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;rice&quot; ] # list syntax is &quot;[]&quot; another_list = shopping_list print(id(shopping_list)) # each object has a uniques id; the id() function returns this id for the specifies object print(id(another_list)) # As shopping_list is attritibuted to another_list, the id for both are the same as the object in questiom does not change print(another_list) shopping_list += [&quot;cookies&quot;] # adding cookies to the list print(shopping_list) print(id(shopping_list)) # the id does not change print(another_list) a = b = c = d = e = f = another_list # it is possibe to atrribute the same object to various variables print(a) print(&quot;Adding cream&quot;) # .append() is a function which can be used to place new items into old lists b.append(&quot;cream&quot;) # changes in one of the variables chnges all the lists in other as the object in question is the same. print(a) print(c) print(d) . 139939430214464 139939430214464 [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] 139939430214464 [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] Adding cream [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;pasta&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bread&#39;, &#39;rice&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;cream&#39;] .

In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks. . . 3D Animation: . . I have already taken this course and it always astonishes me how creative and amzaning some of these 3D animations can be. I loved the above picture the most due to the attention to detail and the background. Also how it focuses on the donut and the lamp make the art really good and impactful. . . ceramics: . . The dolphin is my favorite and I also am fasinated by how they sculpt such things in such short amount of time. I love the mugs as well due to the color and design. . . Studio Art: . . . these drawings are amazing and I love the snikers one the most because it is my favourite chocolate. The other one looks amazing and pulls you in as you stare at it.

Surveys | User testing | Interviews | Direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by Brainstorming (draw on investigation) | Storyboarding the program | Planning user experience | Laying out the user interface | Organizing into modules | Develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that Describe how a program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | The program specifications outline all of the requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way | Testing occurs at the Micro level | Macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throughout can improve: | Efficiency of overall programming process | Programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | Programmers’ response to bugs | . . Final Project Design . Idea/Brain Write . A random quiz generator. Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted. Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user’s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .

This project is also going to hold team members’ interest for 8 weeks because this project can always be improved - whether it be the ideas behind it or the code running the program - and the code will also take time to be finished. This project is pretty complex - not so much that we are uninterested or demotivated - but enough so that we can’t finish it in just a few days. . This project can be used by people beyond the 8 weeks. This program is built so that people can use it. Whenever people input in notes, those notes will be saved and quiz questions will also be generated based on those notes (i.e, Customer Needed). . This project has potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission because it fits the criteria for the collegeboard submission.

This example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finale of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hello, adityanav running /bin/python3 You will be asked 3 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test?

Question: What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! adityanav you scored 3/3 . Python Quiz Method - 2 . In this example a new function is defined &quot;quiz&quot; and then after the parameters of the function are defined. Lastly the code prints the score from the quiz. . The parameters of the function are &quot;que&quot; and &quot;ans&quot;. | The function first prints the ques which is defined in code after the function definition. | Then the variable &quot;correct&quot; is modified to be used outside of the current scope, whit this we can make changes to variable and print the variable in local context. | the variable &quot;input_ans&quot; is attached to the user input for the aswers for the questions. | &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; statems follow, the if statement prints &quot;You got it right!!&quot; if you get it right. and the else prints &quot;Your answer is wrong&quot; if you answer wrong. | correct is gven the value 0 becuase score starts from 0 . Correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation. in this that case after the if statement. | the Function is now defined | . After the function gets defined . a variable questions is given the value of the number of questions present in the question | After this the function parameters are defined with the questions and answers | Last line of code is to print the score | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong. | . correct = 0 def quiz(ques, ans): print(ques) global correct #global keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope input_ans = input(&quot;Answer: &quot;) # user input if ans == input_ans: # if the answer provided is correct print(&quot;You got it right!!&quot;) correct += 1 else: # if the answer provided is wrong print(&quot;Your answer was wrong&quot;) questions = 4 # number of questions quiz(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;, &quot;import&quot;) # defining the quiz function parameters quiz(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;, &quot;if&quot;) quiz(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;) quiz(&quot;Variables for the values the function needs.

Correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation. in this that case after the if statement. . Then the question and their corresponding answers are put in a dictionary. one question and it&#39;s answer is one value in the dictionary. . After that a for statement is made for the two things in one value in the dictionarie to go through the code blelow until the leght of the dictionary finishes. . the .items commnad itterates over every value in the dictionary | we then use the &quot;question_with_response&quot; function to print the questions for the quiz and the parameter of this function is tied to question variable that connects to the dictionary. | &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; statems follow, the if statement prints &quot;You got it right!!&quot; if you get it right. and the else prints &quot;Your answer is wrong&quot; if you answer wrong. | .

Explain how you know using the data you found. . | The precision of the meterstick used is to the 100th of a cm. I know this because I measured exactly to the last millimeter (10th’s place) and then used the 2-5-8 rule for the last uncertain digit (100th’s place) .

Formula:y= 0.012463x^2 + 0.053317-0.099991 . Graph #2- Linearized Graph (Radius)^2 vs Mass . . This is a linearized graph with radius squared(cm^2)(x-axis) and mass(g)(y-axis). . How did we linearize our graph? From the original table , we squared the radius and kept the mass same because we found that the original graph of non-linearized data looked very similar to a parabola and so figured out that, if we square the radius, the graph becomes linearized. . Formula: y=0.018138x . Analysis Questions - . 1) What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? . Radius . | . 2) What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? . The slope represents - density [kg/m^3]; Height/thickness [m]; pie . | . Provide evidence using the dimensions from the known equation and your slope. . . | . 3) Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Consider what theoretically happen if mass or radius is 0. . Yes. The “b” in the formula y = mx + b should be zero. . | the mass of a disk should equal 0 when r2 or r equals 0. . | . 4) Use your linear equation to determine the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Calculate the percent difference between this value and the known density of aluminum. . ( frac{m}{r^{2}} = rho pi h rightarrow 0.018138 lbrack frac{g}{cm^{2}} rbrack = rho3.140.0038 lbrack cm rbrack Rightarrow rho = frac{0.018138}{3.14*0.0038} lbrack frac{g}{cm^{3}} rbrack approx 1.805 frac{g}{cm^{3}}) . | ( rho = frac{m}{r^{2} pi h}) . | So the value of rho for density of aluminum to be 1.805( frac{g}{cm^{3}}). . | The actual value of density of aluminum according to google is - 2.7( frac{g}{cm^{3}}) ; So my percent of error is - 33% . | . 5) Source of errors for the experimental density of aluminum. Make sure you explain what would cause your number to be bigger or smaller than the know value . One of the sources of errors for the experimental density of aluminum is that the disks are not proper circles causing the radius measurements to be incorrect. The radius is inversely proportional to density, so increase in the radius causes a decrease in the density value and vice versa. Added to this is that the disks were folded alot and hence caused incorrect calculations of mass. Mass is directly proportional to density and hence a decrease in the mass causes a decrease in the density and vice versa. All this also could have led to the incorrect calculations of the height, as we calculated the height with the equation hence if the mass is incorrectly recorded then so is the height incorrect. . | . Synthesis Questions - . 1. In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . If we used a greater thickness for the disks then my slope would have been greater as the slope = ( rho pi h) height is directly proportional to the slope and an increase in height will cause an increase in slope. . | Yes, My experimental value for density would have been the same. This is because increasing the thickness would increase in the mass and this will in turn cause the ratio between them to be the same no matter the height. ( rho = frac{m}{r^{2} pi h}) . Hence the density will not change. . | . 2. How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . This change will cause the slope to become even steeper than that of the aluminum graph. This is because the density of steel is greater than the density of aluminum. . | . | 3. Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; | . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to . 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the . density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what . material their disks are made of. . Slope = 122 Kg/m^2 or 12.2 . | Thickness = 0.5 cm or 0.005m . | (slope = rho pi h); so 122 = ( rho)*3.14*0.005 . | ( rho) = 7770.7 Kg/m^3 or 7.77 ( lbrack frac{g}{cm^{3}} rbrack) . | This density value is most similar to the density of iron. So it can be concluded that the disks were made out of iron. . | . Multiple Choice Questions - . 1) &gt; Ans - E. ( frac{h rho}{4 pi}) . 2) &gt; Ans - B . 3) &gt; Ans - C. (r^{3}) .",

Another way to update your repository is by doing it in the power shell. to do this first cd into your cloned repository and then run the command &quot;git add .&quot; after that you run the command git commit -m &quot;your commit message&quot;. This commits your changes after doing so we run the command &quot;git push&quot;, it will prompt you to authenticate yourself and once that is done the repository gets updated. | . | Scripts can be written to automate a procedure from installation. . | . .
