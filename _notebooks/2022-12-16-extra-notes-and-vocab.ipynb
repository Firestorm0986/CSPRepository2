    "## Extra Vocab\n",
    "- Problem: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically\n",
    "- Decision Problem: A problem with a yes or no answer\n",
    "- Organization Problem: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer\n",
    "- Instance: a problem with a specific input\n",
    "- Efficiency: amount of computing needed to solve a problem\n",
    "- Polynomial Efficiency (Good): more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time)\n",
    "- Exponential Efficiency (Bad): more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time)\n",
    "- Heuristic Approach: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient\n",
    "- Decidable Problem: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output\n",
    "- Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution that is not gaurenteed to produce the correct output\n",
    "- special keyword Import requiered to access methods and fucntions\n",
    "- Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word \"from\", followed by the package name, then the word \"import\", then the method. \n",
    "- This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use \"*\".\n",
    "- you can re name the package using \"as\" for example \"import random as rd\"\n",
    "- Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring\n",
    "- Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result\n",
    "- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world\n",
    "- Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world\n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects\n",
    "- Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration\n",
    "- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators\n",
