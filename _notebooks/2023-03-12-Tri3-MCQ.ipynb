    "> - The procedure will not display the correct value of foundIndex if the targetName is \"Ben\". In the FOR EACH loop, when the value of name is \"Andrea\", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. When the value of name is \"Ben\", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 1. But as the loop continues, and the value of name is \"Chris\", the ELSE statement sets foundIndex to 0. The procedure displays 0, even though the correct answer is 1.\n",

When modifications are made to existing programs, documentation is used to record the changes or additions to an existing program."

Since a OR b is true, NOT (a OR b) is false, so (NOT (a OR b)) AND c is false. The fifth statement assigns the value of c AND a to c. Since a is now false, c AND a is false.
