    "This example defines a new function \"question_with_response\", this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- response from \"question_with_response\" is captured in a variable called \"rsp\"\n",
    "    - return command in function returns msg input by user\n",
    "    - assignment to \"rsp\" is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could)\n",
    "- if command is next command in sequence after \"rsp\" assignment\n",
    "    - this command contains an expression, rsp == \"import\" which compare what is typed to the string literal answer\n",
    "    - an if expression is evaluated for true or false\n",
    "    - true takes branch of code directly under if\n",
    "    - false takes branch of code directly under else command\n",
    "\n",
    "The grand finale of this example is calculating the right/total.\n",
    "- question = 3 is defined as number of questions\n",
    "- correct = 0 is defined as running score\n",
    "- correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation\n",
    "- since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string.\n",
    "- final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong"
